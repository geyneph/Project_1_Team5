Introduction
In this data analysis project, we have explored the various habits and factors potentially linked to the risk of experiencing a heart attack. Our primary goal was to uncover distinctive characteristics in patient behavior and determine their correlations with the likelihood of heart attacks. We also aimed to examine the interconnections among different variables within the dataset, particularly in patients at higher risk of heart attacks. This analysis seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of heart disease.

**Participant Demographics**
The study primarily included male participants, accounting for 6,107 out of a total sample of 8,763 patients. Females made up the minority, with 2,655 (30.3%) of the participants.
**Influence of Diet on Heart Attacks**
The majority of patients who had a heart attack followed a "Healthy" diet, with 1,079 individuals (34.37% of the total).
The "Average" diet was most common among those without heart attacks, with 1,886 individuals (33.80% of the total).
"Healthy" and "Unhealthy" diets were nearly equally distributed, with 1,881 (33.72%) and 1,857 (33.48%) individuals, respectively.
**Influence of Alcohol Consumption on Heart Attacks**
Among individuals who experienced heart attacks, 58.9% were regular consumers of alcohol. Interestingly, a similar pattern emerged when comparing this to the population without heart attacks, where 60.3% also engaged in regular alcohol consumption.
**Influence of Exercise on Heart Attacks**
A significant proportion (45.9%) of individuals who suffered heart attacks engaged in exercise 1-3 days per week, while 42% exercised 4-7 days per week. However, 15% of heart attack cases were among those who did not exercise at all. Notably, patients with no risk of heart attack showed a minimal prevalence of physical activity engagement, closely resembling the distribution of patients with a high risk of heart attack.
**Influence of Sleeping Hours on Heart Attacks**
The distribution of sleeping hours revealed moderate peaks at 8 hours for patients with high risk of heart attacks and 10 hours for those with no risk. In both cases, 4 and 9 hours of sleep were the least common results in the sample.
**Influence of Location on Heart Attacks**
Patients at high risk of heart attacks had a significant presence from Asia and Europe. However, the top two countries with the highest number of high-risk patients were Nigeria and Argentina, not part of these continents. Germany also exhibited a substantial risk, with 172 patients.
**Influence of Income on Heart Attacks**
The income distribution showed no distinct pattern, with a lower prevalence of patients falling within the income ranges of 100,000 to 150,000 and 180,000 to 250,000.
**Influence of Triglycerides on Heart Attacks**
Triglyceride levels showed a slight negative bias in patients with a high risk of heart attack. Higher triglyceride levels were associated with a greater number of high-risk patients. In contrast, the distribution of patients with no risk of heart attack was highly asymmetric.
**Influence of Smoking on Heart Attack Risk**
Smoking habits did not reveal significant differences between patients with high and low risks of heart attacks. However, patients who smoke tend to exhibit higher levels of triglycerides, suggesting an indirect relationship between smoking and heart attacks through its influence on triglyceride levels.
**Multifactorial Analysis on Patients with High Risk of Heart Attack**
Alcohol Consumption vs. Income per Age: No discernible correlation between alcohol consumption and age in high-risk heart attack patients.
Age vs. Physical Activity: No apparent association between age and physical activity in high-risk heart attack patients.
Cholesterol Level vs. Physical Activity: No significant relationship identified.
**Conclusions**
The results obtained are highly inconclusive, with significant symmetry observed when comparing the influence of different variables on the risk of experiencing a heart attack.
Limited evidence suggests that diet, alcohol consumption, exercise, and sleeping hours have a significant influence on the likelihood of experiencing a heart attack.
Triglyceride levels may influence patients at a higher risk of heart attack.
Smoking may be indirectly related to heart attacks through its influence on triglyceride levels.
**Limitations**
The methodology of sample selection and the definition of "risk of heart attack" lack clarity.
More comprehensive information about the determination of heart attack risk could offer valuable insights into the results.
This analysis serves as a preliminary exploration of factors related to heart attacks and highlights the need for further investigation and data collection to draw more definitive conclusions.
